## WHAT IS YOUTUBE'S CONTENT-ID SYSTEM

Content owners or Administartors will have access to their assets:

* Metadata

* Policy Information

Furthermore, by combining `Youtube Content ID` with `Youtube Data API`
and `Youtube Player API`, you can enable your app to updload, manage and play videos.

## YOUTUBE CONTENT PARTNER - ALLOWS ACCESS

To use the content-id api, the user must be a Youtube Content Partner.

If you are a Youtube Content Partner you can access the
Content ID Online Interface [here](https://www.youtube.com/content_id?o=U).

You will also see this api listed in google's API Service Manager
[here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard)

## AUTHENTIFICATION - CONTENT-ID USES OAuth 2.0

Google uses many ways to authentificate, such as `API Key`,  `Service Account` or
`OAuth 2.0 Client ID`.

Youtube's Content ID uses `OAuth 2.0 Client ID` for authentification.

Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/OAuth-2.0-authorization-cheat-sheet)
